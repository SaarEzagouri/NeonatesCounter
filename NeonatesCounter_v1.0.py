NeonatesCounter version 1.0, all rights reserved to FreezeM.

This script detects neonates in images using a custom-trained YOLOv8m model. It employs Patchify to divide the image into overlapping patches, runs the YOLO model on each patch, and reconstructs the image with detected objects overlaid. The final output includes an annotated image with bounding boxes and a log file documenting the detections.  

The patch size and stride, set in the `ImagePatcher` class, are fixed at 416Ã—416 with a 376-pixel stride, allowing control over the overlap between patches.
