# NeonatesCounter
Counting neonates of black soldier flies in high resolution images.

### Project Description:
NeonatesCounter.py processes an input image by dividing it into smaller patches, detecting neonates in each patch, and then stitching the patches back together to reconstruct the full image, adding padding if necessary. <br>
The script outputs images with corresponding bounding boxes and generates a .txt file for each image, summarizing the detection results (Figure 1). <br>
